# DBMS Project
## Vamshawali - The Family Tree Project

A database management system project that revolves around ancestry, family tree and clan. The main goal of this project is to implement almost everything we have learned in our dbms course (III/I).

Some of the targets we hope to reach upon completion of this projects are:
1. Implementation of Relational Database Structure to store genealogy information.
2. Mechanism for Insertion, Retrieval and Modification of genealogy information.
3. Exposing API for other developers to build their own UI or Applications that can access our database.
4. A visualization of Family Tree and useful calculation around them.

Some of the side-quests after the completion of main objectives are:
2. Calculating closeness, nearest ancestor of two-people if exist.
1. Calculating relation of any two people.
2. A method to see the Group or Clan that a person belong from, and more information about that clan.
3. A good method to present information about a clan, their origin and history and present status.
